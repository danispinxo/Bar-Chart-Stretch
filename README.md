# About
This is really rough-and-ready, as they say on GBBO, but for me and for where I started, I'm quite proud of the result. This Bar Chart project uses and SVG object to make the bar chart, taking the user's information and using it to create a rect element and adding it into the SVG in the HTML. 

# Context
This is the final stretch project for the prep modules for the Full-Time Web Development Bootcamp that begins July 25th!
